<font size="5px"><p><b>SUSPENSION, EXCLUSION, EXPULSION</b></p></font>
<p align="justify">In accordance with the provisions in the Manual of Regulations for Private
    Schools, 8th Edition 1992, the three categories of disciplinary administrative sanctions for
    serious offense or violation of school rules and regulations, which may be applied on an erring
    pupil or student are suspension, exclusion, and expulsion.</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li align="justify"><font size="5px"><b>Suspension.</b></font> Suspension is a penalty in which
        the school is allowed to deny or deprive an erring pupil or student of attendance in classes
        for a period not exceeding twenty percent (20%) of the prescribed class days for the school
        year or term.<p>The decision of the school in every case involving the penalty of suspension
            which exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the prescribed school days for a school year or
            term shall be forwarded to the Regional Office concerned within ten days from the
            termination of the investigation of each case for its information. </p>
        <p align="justify">(1) <b>Preventive Suspension.</b> A pupil or student under investigation
            of a case involving the penalty of expulsion may be preventively suspended from entering
            the school premises if the evidence of guilt is strong and the school head is morally
            convinced that the continued stay of the pupil or student during the period of
            investigation constitutes a distraction to the normal operations of the school or poses
            a risk or danger to the life of persons or property in the school.</p></li>
    <li align="justify"><font size="5px"><b>Exclusion.</b></font> Exclusion is the penalty in which
        the school is allowed to exclude or drop the name of the erring pupil or student from the
        school roll for being undesirable, and transfer credentials immediately issued. A summary
        investigation shall have been conducted, and no prior approval by the Department is required
        in the imposition of the penalty. <p>The decision of the school on every case involving the
            penalty of exclusion from the roll, together with all the pertinent papers therefore,
            shall be filed in the school for a period of one year in order to afford the Department
            the opportunity to review the case in the event an appeal is taken by the party
            concerned.</p></li>
    <li align="justify"><font size="5px"><b>Expulsion.</b></font> Expulsion is an extreme penalty on
        an erring pupil or student consisting of his exclusion from admission to any public or
        private school in the Philippines and which requires the prior approval of the Secretary.
        The penalty may be imposed for acts or offenses constituting gross misconduct, dishonesty,
        hazing, carrying deadly weapon, immorality, selling and/or possession of dangerous drugs
        such as marijuana, drug dependency, drunkenness, hooliganism, vandalism, and other serious
        school offenses such as assaulting a pupil or student or school personnel, instigating or
        leading illegal strikes or similar concerted activities resulting in the stoppage of
        classes, preventing or threatening any pupil or student or school personnel from entering
        the school premises or attending classes or discharging their duties, forging or tampering
        with school records or school forms, and securing or using forged school records, forms and
        documents.<p>The decision of the school on every case involving the penalty of expulsion,
            together with the supporting paper shall be forwarded to the Regional Office concerned
            within ten days from the termination of the investigation of each case.</p></li>
