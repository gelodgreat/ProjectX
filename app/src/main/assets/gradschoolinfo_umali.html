    The aim of the CEU Graduate School is the development of intellectual independence and
    leadership through the cultivation of scientific&#44; critical&#44; and creative faculties of
    the mind and the promotion of expertise in research.
    <br><br>
    The various fields of specialization provide intensive training for professional workers in
    specific areas; seek to develop leaders and executives through in-depth studies&#44; fieldwork&#44;
    and research; and promote an integrated understanding of the person&lsquo;s place in society.
    <br><br>
    The CEU Graduate School was organized in 1926 during the administration of Dona Librada Avelino&#44;
    founder and first CEU President. Dr. Concepcion A. Aguila was the first Graduate School Dean.
    She was assisted by Dr. Lorenzo Paredes and Miss Generosa de Leon&#44; then CEU Registrar and
    Comptroller. During her deanship (1926-1960)&#44; Dr. Aguila developed and administered programs
    leading to the Doctor of Education and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. CEU thus became the first
    non-sectarian university to offer graduate school courses.
    <br><br>
    Dr. Alicia Jose Ramos&#44; the second dean&#44; (1960-1965) is credited with the expansion of
    the Graduate School and growth in enrolment. In 1965&#44; Dr. Paz Policarpio Mendez was
    appointed third dean. During her term&#44; several new programs on the masters and doctoral
    levels were opened. In 1988&#44; Dr. Rosita L. Navarro was appointed as fourth dean. The term of
    Dr. Navarro marked the start of innovative programs which merited financial support from
    reputable funding agencies. Several graduate degree programs have earned international
    recognition and endowments in the form of professorial chairs and research grants.
    <br><br>
    In 2002&#44; vertical articulation of graduate programs emanating from strong undergraduate
    programs was implemented in CEU. These undergraduate programs are from the School of Accountancy&#44;
    Business&#44; Secretarial&#44; Public Administration&#44; School of Education&mdash;Liberal Arts&mdash;Music&mdash;Social
    Work&#44; School of Pharmacy&#44; School of Tourism-Family Economics-Nutrition and HRM&#44; and
    School of Science.
    <br><br>
    In 2006&#44; the graduate programs of the School of Accountancy&#44; Management and Technology;
    the School of Education&#44; Liberal Arts&#44; Music&#44; and Social Work; and the School of
    Science were granted Level 3 Accredited status by the Philippine Colleges and Universities
    Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA)&#44; which were affirmed in 2007 when the three schools
    were granted Level 3 re-accredited status.
